# InvoiceForm-Text-Extraction-via-PyTesseract
A freelance Computer Vision project that performs image preprocessing operations and four-point-transform on a Invoice form in order to extract the valuable texts from it using PyTesseract OCR. Moreover, the extracted texts are exported into CSV Format based on the form sub-field respective to each text-block.

The purpose of this software is to reduce the time and effort required to manually read  and write the desirable data from Invoice forms into CSV/XLS Formats to save it for later use.
